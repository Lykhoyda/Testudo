Testudo analyzes EIP-7702 delegation contracts to detect malicious patterns 
before you sign. With $12M+ stolen from 15,000+ wallets since May 2025, 
over 90% of delegation requests are linked to phishing attacks.

Testudo scans the delegate contract bytecode for:
- ETH auto-forwarders (sweeper contracts)
- Unlimited token approvals
- DELEGATECALL exploits
- SELFDESTRUCT patterns
- Known malicious addresses

One signature can drain your entire wallet. Testudo helps you spot the trap.
